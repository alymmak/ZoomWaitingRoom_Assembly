# LC-3 Assembly Project

The purpose of this assignment is to write a program in LC-3 assembly language that 
creates a user interface to move students in the waiting room of the EE 306 Zoom classroom to 
the main room. The list of participants is organized as a “LINKED LIST” data structure. There 
are 2 linked lists: one which contains the EIDs of the students already in the main classroom and 
the second list contains the EIDs of students currently in the waiting room.
